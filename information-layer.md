## Data Representation

To represent images we first look at the general idea of representing color, then turn to the
various techniques for digitizing and representing visual information.

Color depth means how much data is used to define a single color. It is measured by the number of bits assigned to represent that color.
A high color display uses 16 bits per pixel. In this format, 5 bits are allocated to each of the three RGB (red, green, blue) components, and the remaining bit is often used for transparency.
A true color display uses 24 bits per pixel. Here, each RGB component is given 8 bits, allowing values from 0 to 255 for each color channel. This makes it possible to display over 16.7 million distinct colors.
Finally, deep color uses 30 bits per pixel in which each RGB component is given 10 bits.

Use the Color Depth Visualizer app to see the differences between them:
